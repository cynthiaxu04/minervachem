# MinervaChem - a python library for cheminformatics and machine learning.

Minervachem implements Graphlet Fingerprints and other utilities cheminformatics and chemical machine learning.

This is an alpha release, so be prepared for breaking changes --
keep track of what version you are using if you need to maintain consistency.

## Installation

There are currently two ways to get `minervachem` up and running: 
1. install from our git repo via pip
2. build conda env from our git repo

Currently, conda is a more robust way to install since there are some complicated dependency resolutions that pip
will ignore. We are in the process of finding which packages need to be pinned to resolve this without overpinning. 


Install requirements with pip:
1. clone this repo and navigate to its root director
2. install rdkit and jupyter lab with `conda install -c conda-forge rdkit`  (this must be done with conda or mamba)
3. install the package with `pip install .`

To install the minervachem conda environment (we recommend using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
instead of conda as it is much faster), 
1. Build environment: you can start a fresh env with `conda env create -n minervachem --file env.yml`. You can use 
`conda install` to instead install these dependencies into an existing environment
2. `pip install .`

### For Developers
You'll also want to run `pip install -r requirements_developer.txt`


## Getting started

We recommend looking through and running the notebooks in the `demos/` directory for a detailed introduction to `minervachem`'s funcitonality.

A few highlights of key features are below.

### Constructing graphlet fingerprints

`Fingerprinter` classes provide reusable objects for generating molecular fingerprints, including the graphlet fingerprints described in our manuscript.

```python
from rdkit.Chem import MolFromSmiles, AddHs
from minervachem.fingerprinters import GraphletFingerprinter

# Benzene
mol = AddHs(MolFromSmiles('c1ccccc1'))

# Reusable Fingerprinter object 
fingerprinter = GraphletFingerprinter(max_len=3)

# Fingerprints are a map from fragment IDs to fragment counts.
# The fragments are identified by their number of atoms and a hash.
fp, bi = fingerprinter(mol)
print(fp)
>>> {(3, 10387847931347882557): 6,
>>>  (2, 10630435057451682469): 6,
>>>  (2, 11665740151475091393): 6,
>>>  (3, 14577436124092730684): 12,
>>>  (1, 20784809936286627226): 6,
>>>  (1, 12794648790135253294): 6}

# We can visualize the above dictiory with a plotting method
from minervachem.plotting import plot_fingerprint
plot_fingerprint(mol, fingerprinter)
```

### scikit-learn transformers

We can quickly construct feature matrices for machine learning from a set of molecules using `minervachem`'s provided `sklearn`-style transformers:

```python
from minervachem.transformers import FingerprintFeaturizer

mols = [MolFromSmiles(s) for s in [
    'c1ccccc1',
    'NCNOCOC',
    'CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C',
    'CNO',
]]

featurizer = FingerprintFeaturizer(
    fingerprinter, 
    n_jobs=2 # parallelism for large datasets
)

# FingerprintFeaturizer implements the sklearn transformer API
feature_matrix = featurizer.fit_transform(mols)
# which generates sparse integer matrices by default
feature_matrix
```
```
>>> <4x39 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
	with 44 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
```

### Building Interpretable Machine Learning Models
#### Model fitting

After constructing a dataset through the methods above, we can use `minervachem` to fit an interpretable ML model. 

The below is a snippet from the demo notebook which fits a hierarchical linear model with ~6,000 coefficients to ~100,000 molecules from QM9. 

```python
import minervachem
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from minervachem.regressors import HierarchicalResidualModel
from minervachem.plotting import parity_plot_train_test


# build a higherarchical residual model
# using a ridge regressor base model 
base_model = Ridge(fit_intercept=False, 
                   alpha=1e-5,
                   solver='sparse_cg')
hmodel = HierarchicalResidualModel(regressor=base_model,verbose=1)
hmodel.fit(X_train,y_train,levels=featurizer.bit_sizes_)

# visualize the train and test performance with 
# minervachem's plotting methods
parity_plot_train_test([X_train, X_test], 
                       [y_train, y_test],
                       hmodel, 
                       figsize=(12, 4),
                       xlab='DFT (kcal/mol)', 
                       ylab='Linear Model (kcal/mol)', 
                       title='Hierarchical Model Prediction');   
```

#### Model interpretations
Linear models are interpretable, but 6,000 coefficients is too many to look at all at once. (The most accurate models in our manuscript had >100,000 coefficients.) So, we use `minervachem`'s projection methods to visualize atom- or bond-level contributions to model predictions for a set of molecules. 

First we construct the Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG) between molecular graphlets that defines our projection operation:

```python
from minervachem.graphlet_dags import GraphletDAG, draw_projected_coefs

# Construct the DAG relating larger graphlets to smaller ones
# for each molecule
dags = []
for mol in mols:
    dag =  GraphletDAG(mol,
                       fingerprinter=featurizer.fingerprinter, # the fingerprinter that creates the graphlets
                       bit_ids=featurizer.bit_ids_, # The bit ids for the features used in the model training
                       coef=hmodel.coef_ # The model coefficients as an array.
                     )
    dags.append(dag)

draw_projected_coefs(dags,
                     level=2, # bond-level interpretations (atom-level is 1)
                    )
```
